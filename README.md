# xfetch
A simple python fetch tool.

## DISCLAIMER
From my testing, xfetch does not work with Solus due to a bug where during the process of getting the username, an OSError is printed out revolving around the following:

OSError 6: No such device or address

## What does it work with then?
Try the following:
Ubuntu Based Distros
Debian
RPM Based Distros
Arch Based Distros
Alpine Based Distros
